PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net cpu/Control/ALUSrc_reg_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin cpu/Control/ALUSrc_reg_i_2/O, cell cpu/Control/ALUSrc_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net cpu/Control/ALU_A_reg_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin cpu/Control/ALU_A_reg_i_2/O, cell cpu/Control/ALU_A_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net cpu/Control/ALUctr_reg[3]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin cpu/Control/ALUctr_reg[3]_i_2/O, cell cpu/Control/ALUctr_reg[3]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.

Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#9 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net cpu/Control/RegDst_reg/G0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin cpu/Control/RegDst_reg/L3_2/O, cell cpu/Control/RegDst_reg/L3_2 (in cpu/Control/RegDst_reg macro). This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>
